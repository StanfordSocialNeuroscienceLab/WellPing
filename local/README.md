To use the content in this folder as a study file, please use

- **(for `private` folder)** `https://local.wellping.ssnl.stanford.edu/FILENAME` (defined by `WELLPING_LOCAL_PRIVATE_URL_PREFIX` constant)
- **(for `debug` folder)** `https://debug.local.wellping.ssnl.stanford.edu/FILENAME` (defined by `WELLPING_LOCAL_DEBUG_URL_PREFIX` constant)

where `FILENAME` is your study file's filename (e.g., `fall2020.json`).

**Notice: due to technical restrictions, you will only be able to use JSON file here as the study file. You may use tools such as [js-yaml CLI executable](https://github.com/nodeca/js-yaml#cli-executable) to generate the JSON file from the YAML file.**
